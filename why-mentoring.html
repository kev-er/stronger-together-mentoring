        <ul>
          <li>
            I am friendly and don’t make negative judgements about who you, as I am aware that life is full of difficult challenges and we invariably try our best with what we have.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            I will listen and provide a safe space for you to explore what you are wanting to address and I will encourage and support you to see the value of who you are. As I mentor, I bring something of my life experiences and while I don’t solve your problems (as that is your job), I may offer potential ideas for you to measure and see if they work for you.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            I may kindly and supportively challenge something you say in order to seek clarification or to notice something that may help you make your change.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            I offer a 20 minute FREE consultation to see if we can work together before we commit to working together.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            As we journey together, we will have regular reviews to see how it is going.
